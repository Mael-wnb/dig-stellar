# Dig Stellar — Status Board

## Purpose

This file is the operational progress board for Dig Stellar. It answers, quickly and honestly:
- where the project stands right now
- which grant deliverables are closest to completion
- what is still partial or fragile
- what the next execution step should be

Keep it short, practical, and frequently updated. Keep it aligned with `docs/grant-roadmap.md`
(the contract + interpretation) and `docs/current-state.md` (the detailed reality).

---

## Status scale

**Delivery status:** Done · Substantially done · Partial · Early · Blocked
**Confidence** (how close to genuinely usable / claimable): High · Medium · Low

---

## Global status

- Current phase: Beta structuring and tranche-aligned execution
- Current focus: Tranche 1 maturity (D1 evidence package, D2 polish, D3 now functionally proven)
- Closest tranche-critical targets: T1-D1 and T1-D2
- Biggest current risk: operationalization (freshness exposure, health, retry/backoff) and the
  remaining API-centralization gap lag implementation progress
- Main execution goal: convert real implementation progress into clearly evidenced, claim-ready
  deliverables
- Last updated: 2026-06-08

# Tranche 1 — MVP

| Deliverable | Status | Completion | Confidence | Current evidence | Main remaining gap | Next action |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| D1 — Data Indexing Foundation (Horizon & Soroban) | Substantially done | 90% | High | Hybrid Horizon+Soroban ingestion live into one Postgres DB; canonical `job:refresh` pipeline (72→71→steps) writing raw SQL v1; **verified DB inspection (Jun 5)**: Blend 3 pools / Aquarius 4 / Soroswap 2, all non-zero TVL (≈$156.7M / $21.0M / $0.57M); synchronous `as_of` within one refresh cycle; served via `/v1/*` | Freshness exposure through the API, retry/backoff standardization, ingestion runbook, evidence package; resolve the `/protocols` vs `/v1` endpoint naming at claim time | Build the T1-D1 evidence package |
| D2 — Analytics Dashboard MVP | Substantially done | 88% | High | Public beta live; protocol/pool views show TVL/volume/APY from indexed data; Stellar Wallets Kit integrated; runs on real Mainnet data; **`GET /v1/network/stats` now DB-backed** (reads `network_stats_latest` written by indexer step `73-network-stats-refresh` via `job:refresh`; no live external fetch per request; `updatedAt` = real `as_of`) | Responsive pass; stale/loading/error consistency; two network-stats fields (`activeWallets`, `dexVolume24hUsd`) null due to a stale stellar.expert endpoint (pre-existing, minor) | Responsive + stale/loading/error pass; fix stellar.expert endpoint |
| D3 — Smart Transaction Builder (Testnet) | Substantially done | 70% | Medium | **End-to-end SDEX swap proven on Testnet from the UI (Jun 8)**: backend `POST /v1/actions/sdex/swap` returns a multi-op XDR (`ChangeTrust` + `PathPaymentStrictSend`); signed in-wallet via Freighter through Stellar Wallets Kit; submitted on-chain (tx `78323ffd…`), `ChangeTrust` op succeeded. `actions/` module in `apps/api` (SDEX + Blend deposit endpoints). Network toggle + `SdexSwapWidget` wired into the production frontend. Backend never touches keys. | Swap op fails on `pathPaymentStrictSendTooFewOffers` (no Testnet SDEX liquidity for the pair — infra, not a code bug); Blend deposit (Soroban, sequential) built but not yet exercised end-to-end from UI; minor: `getAssetBalance` re-bundles `ChangeTrust` even when trustline exists; evidence package | Capture T1-D3 evidence (tx hash + on-chain proof); optionally make one swap fully succeed (provide liquidity or pick a funded pair) |

# Tranche 2 — Expansion

| Deliverable | Status | Completion | Confidence | Current evidence | Main remaining gap | Next action |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| D1 — Multi-Wallet Portfolio & "Active Signer" Model | Partial | 60% | Medium | Grouped multi-wallet behavior real (add/remove/refresh/select); backend grouping by persistent `userId`; per-wallet balances; raw SQL v2 tables (`user_wallets`, `wallet_balance_snapshots`, `wallet_protocol_positions`) | "Active Signer" vs "watch-only" not formalized (model + UI); position aggregation beyond balances is thin | Define + document active-signer vs watch-only semantics |
| D2 — In-App Alerting Engine | Early | 10% | Low | Product direction exists; some notification-like UI | No rule/preference model, evaluator, storage, or notification lifecycle | Minimal rule model + periodic evaluator over `*_metrics_latest` deltas (one rule family first) |
| D3 — Bridge Flow Monitoring | Early | 5% | Low | Grant-level intent only | No Allbridge adapter, normalized inflow model, or dashboard slice | Define inflow model + build the Allbridge attribution adapter |

# Tranche 3 — Mainnet / Operational maturity

| Deliverable | Status | Completion | Confidence | Current evidence | Main remaining gap | Next action |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| D1 — Mainnet Deployment & Freshness Tracking | Partial | 40% | Medium | Real Mainnet data already powers Blend, Soroswap, Aquarius, native DEX; refresh jobs operational; persisted timestamps | Stale detection + exponential backoff + UI staleness not first-class; production topology + health visibility; **DeFindex coverage belongs here** (scaffolded `run:defindex`/`@defindex/sdk`, not validated) | Make the freshness system first-class; complete + validate DeFindex |
| D2 — Non-Custodial Mainnet Actions | Early | 5% | Low | Wallet foundation exists; **T1-D3 now proves the build → sign-in-wallet → execute path on Testnet** — the same builder code targets mainnet (only contract addresses + network differ) | Depends on T1-D3 maturity; hard KPIs (50+ unique mainnet wallets, 200+ mainnet transactions) | Finish T1-D3 (full success demo + Blend pattern), then extend to mainnet narrowly |
| D3 — Observability, UI/UX Polish & Reference Handoff | Early | 20% | Low | `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres+Redis) exists as local-dev stack; architecture is modular; docs effort started | Real `/health` + RPC latency/error metrics; packaged SDF reference implementation + docs; final report w/ adoption metrics (depends on T3-D2 KPIs) | Add health/metrics endpoints incrementally |

## Strongest areas right now
1. Horizon + Soroban indexing foundation (verified coverage + freshness)
2. Protocol analytics architecture (raw SQL v1 pipeline → `/v1/*`)
3. Backend/API foundation
4. Transaction builder: non-custodial SDEX swap proven end-to-end on Testnet (build → sign → submit)
5. Grouped multi-wallet portfolio flows (raw SQL v2)
6. Wallet balance snapshot/refresh flows
7. Clear separation between web, api, and indexer

## Weakest areas right now
1. Alerting engine
2. Bridge monitoring
3. Freshness/stale/retry operationalization + observability
4. Deployment maturity
5. Transaction builder breadth: only one pair/action proven; Blend deposit not yet exercised from UI

## Best near-term tranche wins
1. T1-D1 evidence package (closest claim)
2. T1-D2 final polish (responsive + stale/loading/error) — network stats now DB-backed
3. T1-D3 evidence package (tx hash + on-chain proof already in hand)
4. T2-D1 active-signer model formalization

## Update rule

Update when: a deliverable moves in maturity, a blocker is removed, a gap becomes clearer, the next
tranche-critical target changes, or a partial area becomes substantially done. When in doubt, prefer
realism over optimism. Mirror any status change into `docs/grant-roadmap.md` (interpretation layer)
and `docs/current-state.md`.
